# SnakeGame: A Classic Arcade Experience in Java

## Overview

This project implements the classic Snake game, a timeless arcade favorite, using Java with a Swing-based graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a simple yet engaging gameplay experience, demonstrating fundamental concepts of game development and GUI programming in Java.

## Features

*   **Classic Snake Gameplay:** Navigate the snake to consume food, grow in length, and avoid collisions with walls or its own body.
*   **Dynamic Food System:** Includes different types of food with varying effects on gameplay (e.g., regular food for growth, special food with unique power-ups).
*   **Intuitive Controls:** Simple keyboard-based controls for seamless snake movement.
*   **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your high score as you progress.
*   **Configurable Game Settings:** Easily adjust game parameters such as speed, board size, and initial snake length.

## Technologies Used

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** The core platform for application development.
*   **Swing:** Java's GUI toolkit for building the game's user interface.
*   **Apache Maven:** A powerful project management and comprehension tool for building, testing, and deploying the application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher**
*   **Apache Maven 3.6.0 or higher**

### Building and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd snakeJavaUI
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.)*

2.  **Compile the project:**
    Navigate to the project's root directory (`snakeJavaUI`) and execute the following Maven command:
    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

3.  **Run the game:**
    After successful compilation, you can run the game using Maven:
    ```bash
    mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.snakegame.SnakeGame"
    ```

## Project Structure

The project follows a standard Maven directory structure. Key components are organized as follows:

*   `src/main/java/com/snakegame/`:
    *   `controller/`: Handles game logic and user input.
    *   `model/`: Defines game entities (e.g., Snake, Food, Point) and their behavior.
    *   `view/`: Manages the graphical representation of the game.
    *   `config/`: Configuration classes for game settings.
    *   `enums/`: Enumerations for game elements like `Direction` and `FoodType`.
